ðŸ“± Project: Farming Assistant â€“ Smart Farming App
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

Farming Assistant is an AI and IoT-powered smart farming mobile application designed to help farmers detect plant diseases, monitor crop health, and optimize agricultural practices. 
The app leverages IoT devices (sensors for soil, temperature, humidity, moisture) and AI/ML models for plant disease detection through leaf image analysis. 
Built using Flutter for cross-platform support and Firebase for real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage, the system provides farmers with instant insights, notifications, and 
recommendations to improve productivity.



### ðŸ”¹ Objectives

* Detect plant diseases using AI/ML models from crop leaf images.
* Monitor soil health and environmental conditions via IoT sensors.
* Provide farmers with real-time alerts and recommendations.
* Store and manage farm data securely with Firebase.
* Support multilingual interface for easy adoption by rural farmers.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features

1. **IoT Integration**

   * Soil moisture, temperature, and humidity monitoring.
   * Automatic irrigation alerts.

2. **AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection**

   * Leaf image upload or live camera scan.
   * AI/ML model predicts disease type with confidence score.
   * Suggests preventive and curing measures.

3. **Farmer Dashboard**

   * Crop health overview.
   * Real-time IoT sensor data visualization.
   * Notifications & recommendations.

4. **Firebase Backend**

   * Authentication (Email/Phone/Google login).
   * Real-time database for crop & sensor data.
   * Cloud Firestore for storing disease records.
   * Push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

5. **User-Friendly Interface (Flutter)**

   * Lightweight and multilingual.
   * Works on Android & iOS.

### ðŸ”¹ System Architecture

1. **IoT Sensors â†’ Firebase Realtime Database** (for live crop/soil data).
2. **Mobile App (Flutter)** fetches data from Firebase.
3. **AI/ML Model (TFLite)** embedded in the app for disease detection.
4. **Disease data + Sensor data** stored in Firebase.
5. **User gets recommendations + notifications** on crop health.

### ðŸ”¹ Expected Outcomes

* Early detection of crop diseases â†’ reduced crop loss.
* Automated monitoring of soil & environment.
* Better decision-making for irrigation & pesticide use.
* Increased crop yield and farmer profit.
* Scalable solution for smart agriculture.
