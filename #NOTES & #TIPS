- For proper normalization, adapt `DiseaseModel` preprocessing to your model.
- Upload detected images to Firebase Storage and store the download URL in
Firestore if needed.


Tips
Convert your PyTorch/TensorFlow model to TFLite with dynamic range or float16 quantization for
speed.
Keep input size small (e.g., 224x224) and add normalization ops matching training.
Ensure label order matches output indices.
